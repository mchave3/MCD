## Synopsis

Loads workflow definitions from module and USB profile directories.

## Description

Scans for workflow JSON files in the module's Workflows directory and optionally
from a USB profile directory. Returns parsed workflow objects sorted with the
default workflow first, then alphabetically by name. Invalid JSON files are
skipped with a warning. Missing step commands are warned about but do not cause
failures.
