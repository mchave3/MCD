# Remove-MCDUSBLetters

Source: `source/Private/Workspace/USB/Remove-MCDUSBLetters.ps1`

## Synopsis

Removes all drive letter access paths from a disk's partitions.

## Description

Removes all access paths (drive letters) from all partitions on the specified
disk. This is an OSD-style safety pattern to prevent Windows from automatically
reassigning drive letters during destructive disk operations.

Returns a collection of removed access paths that can be passed to
Restore-MCDUSBLetters to restore them after operations complete.

This function is typically used before Format-MCDUSB and restored after
Copy-MCDBootImageToUSB completes.

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Mandatory | Pipeline | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DiskNumber | Int32 | Yes | No | The disk number to remove access paths from. |

## Examples

### Example 1

```powershell
$removedPaths = Remove-MCDUSBLetters -DiskNumber 2

Removes all drive letters from disk 2 and stores the info for later restoration.
```

### Example 2

```powershell
$removedPaths = Remove-MCDUSBLetters -DiskNumber 2
# ... perform disk operations ...
Restore-MCDUSBLetters -RemovedPaths $removedPaths

Full pattern: remove letters, operate, restore letters.
```
