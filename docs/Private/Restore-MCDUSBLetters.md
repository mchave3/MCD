# Restore-MCDUSBLetters

Source: `source/Private/Workspace/USB/Restore-MCDUSBLetters.ps1`

## Synopsis

Restores previously removed drive letter access paths to disk partitions.

## Description

Restores access paths (drive letters) that were previously removed by
Remove-MCDUSBLetters. This function attempts to restore the same drive
letters to the same partition numbers they were removed from.

If the original drive letter is no longer available (assigned to another
drive), the function logs a warning and skips that access path.

This is the second half of the OSD-style drive letter safety pattern.

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Mandatory | Pipeline | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RemovedPaths | PSObject[] | Yes | No | Collection of removed path objects returned by Remove-MCDUSBLetters. |

## Examples

### Example 1

```powershell
$removedPaths = Remove-MCDUSBLetters -DiskNumber 2
# ... perform disk operations ...
Restore-MCDUSBLetters -RemovedPaths $removedPaths

Restores all previously removed drive letters.
```
