# Format-MCDUSB

Source: `source/Private/Workspace/USB/Format-MCDUSB.ps1`

## Synopsis

Formats a USB drive with Boot (FAT32) and Deploy (NTFS) partitions for MCD bootable media.

## Description

Clears and reformats the specified USB drive with a dual-partition layout:
- Boot partition: 2 GB FAT32 for UEFI boot files
- Deploy partition: Remaining space as NTFS for deployment content

This is a DESTRUCTIVE operation that will erase all data on the target disk.
The function requires ShouldProcess confirmation and validates that the target
disk is a removable USB drive before proceeding.

This function uses the OSD-style drive letter safety pattern: existing access
paths are removed before operations and can be restored after completion.

| Name | Type | Mandatory | Pipeline | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| BootPartitionSizeGB | Int32 | No | No | Size of the Boot partition in gigabytes. Default is 2 GB. |
| BootPartitionLabel | String | No | No | Volume label for the Boot partition. Default is 'Boot'. |
| DeployPartitionLabel | String | No | No | Volume label for the Deploy partition. Default is 'Deploy'. |
